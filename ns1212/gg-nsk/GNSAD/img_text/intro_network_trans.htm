<p>This graphic describes transactions from a table on node \A and a table on node \B being captured from the TMF Audit files and written to trails on each node by Extract processes. A Reader process on each node then picks up the transactions from the trails and sends them to one Coordinator process. The Coordinator waits until each transaction has completed processing before sending the transactions to the \AA backup node for \A and the \BB backup node for \B.</p>
