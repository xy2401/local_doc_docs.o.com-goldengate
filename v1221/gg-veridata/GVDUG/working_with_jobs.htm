<p>Once you have configured groups and compare pairs into jobs, you can run those jobs. Oracle GoldenGate Veridata enables you to control which groups and compare pairs are processed during any given job run, and with which runtime parameters. Once a job is running, you have easy access to views of current and finished runs.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.2</span> Estimating Comparison Time</h2>
<p>When tables are large, you might want to estimate the amount of time that a comparison will take before running a full comparison. To get an estimate, run a test comparison of a limited number of rows. For example, if there are 100 million rows in a table, you can run a comparison for the first million rows and then multiply that amount of time by 100.</p>
<p>To specify the number of rows compared</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the navigation pane, click <span class="bold">Profile Configuration</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the list, click the name of the profile that is linked to the job (or select it, and then click <span class="bold">Edit</span>). The Edit Profile page is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Initial Compare</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under General, clear the <span class="bold">Use Default</span> box for the Limit Number of Input Rows setting, and then type the number of rows that you want to compare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After running the test comparison, change Limit Number of Input Rows back to the default for the full comparison run.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.3</span> Running A Job</h2>
<p>Jobs are executed from the Run/Execute Job page. Any job that has been previously configured can be run from this page. Before running a job, you may want to estimate its duration (see <a href="#BABIIIDG">Estimating Comparison Time</a>).</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG254"></a>Running a job without modification</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For Job, select a job from the drop-down list or click the <span class="bold">Browse</span> button to open the Select a Job page, where you can use filters to constrain the selection choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optional) Under Filters, type a string in Names Like or Names Not Like to include or exclude jobs by name, and then click <span class="bold">Apply Filter</span> to display the selected jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a job from the list by clicking in the Select column. You can only start one job at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <span class="bold">Select</span> button to select the job and close the Select a Job page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) For Job Profile, select a profile if you want it to override the profile that is linked to this job. You can select from the drop-down list or click the <span class="bold">Browse</span> button to open the Select a Profile page, where filters are provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Under Filters, type a string in Names Like or Description Like to include profiles based on their names or a string in their descriptions, and then click <span class="bold">Apply Filter</span> to display the selected profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click in the Select column next to the name of the profile that you want to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <span class="bold">Select</span> button to select the profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Run Job</span>. By default, all compare pairs that are linked to the selected job will be processed, even though their names do not appear in the Compare Pairs list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG255"></a>Modifying a job before running it</p>
<p>After selecting the job and (optional) profile, click <span class="bold">Retrieve Compare Pair List</span>. All of the compare pairs in the job are displayed in the Compare Pairs list, and all are selected by default.</p>
<p>The compare pairs are organized according to the groups that contain them, with the groups listed in alphabetical order; for an example, see <a href="#BABEFEJD">How groups are shown on the Run/Execute Job page</a>.</p>
<p>About the list columns:</p>
<p>The following information is displayed in the Compare Pairs list. This information can help you to refine the job configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Previous Comparison Status</span>: Indicates the results of the previous comparison run of the compare pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Row Partitions</span>: Enables you to configure or override row partitions (see the steps below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Previous Run Duration</span>: The length of time that the previous comparison took. Can be used as a basis for estimating the duration of the next comparison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Compare Pair Name</span>: The name of the compare pair. To view actual object names, hover the mouse over the name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Previous Number Rows Compared</span>: The number of rows that were compared in the previous run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Previous Number Rows Out Of Sync</span>: The number of rows that were out of synchronization in the previous run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Delta Base Time</span>: Shows the end time of the previous comparison, which provides a start time on which to base delta processing for the next run (see the steps below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Previous Comparison Reports</span>: Links to comparison reports from previous runs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Filter the list, if necessary.</p>
<p>To filter the list of compare pairs, expand Filters to expose filter options. You can filter the list of compare pairs by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Group Names Like</span>: Type a search string to show names that contain the string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Compare Pairs</span>: You can filter compare pairs based on their previous comparison status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Compare Pair Name Like</span>: Type a string to filter by the name of the compare pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Source Table Name Like</span>: Type a string to filter by the name of the source table or file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Target Table Name Like</span>: Type a string to filter by the name of the target table or file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After you specify your filter criteria, click <span class="bold">Apply Filter</span>. By default, all items that the filter returns are selected for processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the compare pairs that you want to be processed in this job.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To select all of the compare pairs (in all of the groups) in the list, make certain that the All check box displays a check mark. (This box is located directly above the Compare Pairs header.) This action affects only the compare pairs that are in the list, not any that were excluded by means of the filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To deselect all of the compare pairs in the list, clear All. To deselect all when some pairs are selected and others are not, you might need to click <span class="bold">All</span> twice, once to select all and once to deselect all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To select all of the compare pairs that are in a given group, click the Select box beneath the name of the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To include or exclude an individual compare pair, select or clear the Select box next to its name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn how navigate a large list, see <a href="get_started.htm#CIHHIIFC">Managing the Page View</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To configure or override row partitions, click in the Configure in the Row Partitions column to open the row partitions editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To change the default job attributes and profile parameters, click the <span class="bold">Set Override Run Options</span> link to go to the Run Options page (see <a href="#BABFGGFF">Configuring run options</a>).</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The <span class="bold">Command Line To Be Used</span> box shows the underlying Vericom command that will be used to run this job. For more information about Vericom, see the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata Administrator Guide.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If delta processing is enabled for any of the compare pairs in this job, the <span class="bold">Delta Processing Enabled</span> check box is shown. To disable delta processing, clear the check box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Run Job</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG256"></a>What happens when you run a job</p>
<p>The groups that you selected for processing will be scheduled in the order shown in the list, but they may not be processed in that order. The time that it takes to process each group depends on the size of that group, the operating system that is hosting the database, the speed of the database, the system resources that are available and their activity, and various other factors. Because Oracle GoldenGate Veridata uses multi-threaded processing, groups could start running out of order. This is normal. To start a particular group right away, assign it to a dedicated job, and then run that job before the other ones.</p>
<p>Running jobs remain running when you log out of Oracle GoldenGate Veridata Web. When you log in again, you will see current statistics if the job is still running, or you will see results if the job has finished.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>General (No Comparisons Performed)</p>
<p>Select only one of these items for any given run, as they are mutually exclusive.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Review Previous Out-Of-Sync Results</span>: Compares only those rows that were out-of-sync in the previous run, based on the information that is stored in the Out-of-Sync file. Oracle GoldenGate Veridata will compare these rows against their current state. The results identify which rows were brought back into synchronization by replication or another method. By default, this parameter is disabled. Check Value to enable it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Generate Out-Of-Sync XML from Previous Run</span>: Generates an OOSXML file based on the OOS file from the previous run. It generates XML for every row from the OOS file. You can use the XML from this file for your own purposes, such as to view the out-of-sync information in an XML editor. By default, this parameter is disabled. Check Value to enable it. When this parameter is enabled, Review Previous Out-Of-Sync Results is ignored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profile Setting Overrides</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Max Concurrent Comparison Threads</span>: Specifies the number of concurrent processing threads to use. You can use up to the same number of threads as there are processors on the server system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Delay Confirm-Out-Of-Sync By (seconds)</span>: Delays the confirmation step by the specified number of seconds to account for replication lag. Delaying the confirmation step reduces the number of false out-of-sync results that occur because an updated source value was not replicated fast enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Perform Confirm-Out-Of-Sync Step</span>: Controls whether or not the confirmation step is performed. By default, it is performed. Clear the check box under Value to skip the confirmation step and only perform the initial (row hash) comparison. You might skip the confirmation step if, for example, activity on the source tables is quiesced or if replication is not continuously updating the target table(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Out-Of-Sync Output Format</span>: Controls how out-of-sync row information is written to the OOS file on disk. The default is binary format, which is compatible with the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata Web User Interface browser. To change the output option, select one of the following under Value:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To output only in XML, select XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To output in both binary and XML formats, select Both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To suppress out-of-sync output, select None.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Maximum Size of Each Out-Of-Sync XML Chunk (Rows)</span>: Limits the number of out-of-sync rows that are written to an XML-based OOS report chunk. The OOS file is actually written as several files to prevent one file from becoming so large that it affects system resources. Using chunks enables periodic archiving or purging to remove aged files. The current file is closed when the specified number of rows is written, and a new file is opened.</p>

<p>Under View List By, you can set the way that the list is displayed: by Job, Group, or Compare Pair. The view determines the context for the information that is in the columns of the list. This is the same as using the context nodes under Running Jobs.</p>
<p>For example, with Group as the view, the Compare Pairs Processed column shows the number of compare pairs that are being processed for any given group. By contrast, if you change the view to Job, that same column would then show the number of compare pairs that are being processed for any given job.</p>
<p>View By Job is the default view when you click <span class="bold">Running Jobs</span> in the navigation pane, but you can change that with user preferences (see <a href="customizing_your_workspace.htm#BABHAAAA">Setting user preferences</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under List Columns to View, you can refine your chosen view by selecting or deselecting the names of columns to display.</p>
<p>For example, you might want to limit the information to a basic overview of name, status, and number of out-of-sync rows. To get more information, you can always drill down to pages that contain more detail.</p>
<p>The columns that you can work with depends on the view that you select.</p>
<p>Your column filters only apply to the active page. If you leave this page and then return to it, the column list reverts to the default for the view that is selected.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">3.4.1</span> Managing common tasks</h3>
<p>Use the Favorites manager to store links to jobs and tasks that you work on frequently. Your favorites are stored in the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata repository as part of your user profile. Your favorites are available only to you and are visible on any page of the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata Web User Interface application at the lower left-hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>Like the way that favorites or bookmarks work in a web browser, clicking a Favorites link takes you directly to the underlying job or task without requiring navigation or filtering. For example, if you have a large number of tables to map, and you want to complete part of the task today and the rest tomorrow, simply save today's work to the repository and then add the mapping page to the shortcuts list. When you return tomorrow, click the link in Favorites instead of navigating to the task from the navigation pane. Similarly, if you run a job frequently, add it as a favorite job and then click the link in Favorites instead of running it from the Run/Execute Job page.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">3.4.1.1</span> Using Favorite Jobs</h4>
<p>Use the Jobs section of the Favorites manager to store links to jobs that you work with frequently. Only jobs can be added to this section. If you try to add a group or compare pair, the name of the container job is added to Favorites.</p>
<p>A favorite job can be added from the Edit Job page and the Details For Finished Job page.</p>
<p>You can set your Home page User Preference settings to only show these favorite jobs.</p>
<p>You will always see the latest data available for a favorite job. For example, if the job just finished running, you will see the same data that appears on the Finished Jobs page.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG275"></a>To add a favorite job:</p>
<p>You can add a favorite job when (and only when) you see an Add link in the Favorites manager next to Jobs.</p>
<p>To add a job to the Jobs list, click the <span class="bold">Add</span> link next to Jobs. The name of the job is then displayed in the Jobs section.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">3.4.1.2</span> Using Shortcuts</h4>
<p>Use the Shortcuts section of the Favorites manager to store links to a specific object, a previous job, a group, a report, or other workflow object.</p>
<p>You cannot add a job to the Jobs list and then also add it to the Shortcuts list. However, you can save a different run of that job to the Shortcuts list. When adding a finished job to the Shortcuts list, you can control whether the link goes to the latest run or a specific run from history.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG277"></a>To add a favorite shortcut</p>
<p>You can add a favorite shortcut when (and only when) you see an Add link in the Favorites manager next to Shortcuts. To add a shortcut to the Shortcuts list, take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the <span class="bold">Add</span> link next to Shortcuts. The Add to Favorites dialog is displayed, with the name of the object appearing in the Task Data box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type a description in the Description box. Spaces are permissible. Important! This description is what will appear in the Shortcuts list, so the best practice is to keep it short.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(For a finished group, job, or compare pair only) Under Task Type, you can select one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To always see the latest status or data of a finished job, group, or compare pair, select <span class="bold">Always Use Latest Data</span>. Whenever the status of the object changes, the current state is shown (for example, the most recent run of a job). Note that this is the forced default for objects that are not a job, group, or compare pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To create a static snapshot of the status or data of a finished job, group, or compare pair as of the current date and time, select <span class="bold">Use Data At This Specific Point In Time</span>. Creating one or more snapshot views is useful for comparing one comparison run against another. You must give each snapshot of the same finished object a different name. For example, you can create one shortcut named ALL_3_31 and another shortcut named ALL_6_30 for the same job that is run at the end of March and at the end of June.</p>

<p>You can edit the properties of a saved job or shortcut. The edit properties may differ slightly depending on which Favorite type it is.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG279"></a>To edit a favorite job or shortcut</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Favorites manager, click <span class="bold">Edit</span> in the header bar of the Jobs or Shortcuts section that contains the object that you want to edit. The Favorites Task list is displayed. The Favorites column shows which type of Favorite the item is: Job or Shortcut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If needed, expand Filter to filter the list based on one or both of the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <span class="bold">Description</span> to filter based on the name of a job or shortcut. Do not use a wildcard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Shortcuts only) Use Task Type Like to filter shortcuts based on whether the type is Always Use Latest Data or Use Data at This Specific Point in Time. When combined with the Description filter, the Task Type filter is a powerful way to immediately focus on all of the snapshots of one or more jobs, groups, or compare pairs that you saved as Shortcuts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To edit a job or shortcut, click its name in the Description column of the list, and then make your changes on the Task Detail page.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">3.5.3.1</span> Using the charts</h4>
<p>The charts on this page help you to determine what types of operations are causing the most out-of-sync conditions and which phases of processing are taking the most time to complete.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG312"></a>Overall Rows Compared pie chart</p>
<p>Plots the result from the Overall Rows Compared field according to the possible outcomes of the comparison: In-Sync or Out-Of-sync.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG313"></a>Operations Out-Of-Sync pie chart</p>
<p>Plots the number of out-of-sync rows according to their operation type:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Inserts</span>: source table has the row, but the target does not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Updates</span>: source table has different row values from the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Deletes</span>: target table has the row, but the source does not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG314"></a>Compare Pair Performance table</p>
<p>Lists performance statistics based on each phase of a run: the sorting phase (for source and target), the initial comparison phase, and the confirmation phase. Note: sorting statistics are only available if the job profile specifies server-side sorting (row sorts are performed by Oracle GoldenGate Veridata, not by the database engines).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Start Time</span>: The time that a run phase started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run Duration</span>: The amount of time that it took to complete a run phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Rows Processed</span>: The number of rows that were processed in a run phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Rows Per Second</span>: The performance rate of a run phase, in terms of rows processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Bytes Processed</span>: The overall volume of data, in bytes, that was processed in a run phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Rows Per Second</span>: The performance rate of a run phase, in terms of bytes processed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="GVDUG315"></a>Compare Pair Performance History chart</p>
<p>Plots the performance of each of the run phases as a bar chart. To use this chart:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From View Step, select a run phase to plot.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial comparison step: Select Initial Compare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmation step: Select Confirm Out-Of-Sync.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting process: Select Sorting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From View Performance History By, select the criterion for this performance analysis. This sets the units of measure for the vertical axis of the chart. You can measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of rows or bytes that were processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of rows or bytes per second that were processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run duration (the time spent processing the rows)</p>
</li>
</ul>
